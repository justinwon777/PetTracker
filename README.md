## Quick Guide

Craft the tracker using one stick and one emerald:

Right click on your pets to add them to the tracker.
- Trackers are independent of each other. Each tracker keeps its own list of pets.
- Modded pets should work as long as they extend the vanilla Tameable entity class.

Right click to open the tracker screen:

## Tracker Options

**Teleport:** Teleports mob to you. If the mob is dead or in an unloaded chunk, teleport button will not be available, and the location shown is the last known location.

**Remove:** Removes mob from the list. You can only remove one at a time, so to remove multiple, remove one, then reopen tracker to remove more.
